#### What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes) which are used to create individual instances of objects. Because OOP is a programming paradigm, there are many object-oriented programming languages including: C++, Java, and Python.

A programmer designs a software program by organizing related pieces of information and behaviors together into a template called a class. Then individual objects are created from the class template. The entire software program runs by having multiple objects interact with objects to create the larger program

OOP makes code organized, reusable, and easy to maintain. It follows the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle used by many programmers to make efficient programs.
It also prevents unwanted access to data, or exposing proprietary code through encapsulation and abstraction. 

#### What is Procedural Programming?
Procedural programming is a method of the programming which has a support of splitting the functionalities into a number of procedures. In procedural programming, a large program is broken down into smaller manageable parts called procedures or functions. Here, priority is given on functions rather than data. In a procedural programming language, a program basically consists of a sequence of instructions each of which tells the computer to do something such as reading inputs from the user, doing the necessary calculation, displaying output.
